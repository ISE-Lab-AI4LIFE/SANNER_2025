- To delete task data, call the delete_task method with the ID of the task to delete. This will remove the subdirectory containing the task data.
- To find task data by ID, call the find_by_id method with the ID of the task to find. This will return the task data as a dictionary.
- To find task data for multiple IDs, call the find_by_ids method with a list of IDs. This will return a list of task data dictionaries.
- To find all task data, call the all_task_data method. This will return a list of all task data dictionaries, sorted by ID in ascending order by default (or descending order if the 'order' parameter is set to 'desc').

3. Create a TimedRotatingFileHandler instance with the following parameters: filename=""test"", when='s', interval=2, backupCount=5, encoding='UTF-8'.
4. Set the suffix of the handler to '%Y-%m-%d-%H-%M-%S.log'.
5. Set the extMatch of the handler to re.compile(r'^\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}-\d{2}-\d{2}-\d{2}.log$').
6. Create a Formatter instance with the format string ""%(asctime)s %(message)s"".
7. Set the formatter of the handler to the Formatter instance created in step 6.
8. Get the root logger using logging.getLogger().
9. Add the handler to the root logger using root_logger.addHandler(handler).
10. Set the level of the root logger to logging.INFO using root_logger.setLevel(logging.INFO).
11. Create a RotatingFileHandler instance with the following parameters: filename='test.log', maxBytes=1024, backupCount=3.
12. Set the formatter of the handler to the Formatter instance created in step 6.
13. Add the handler to the root logger using root_logger.addHandler(handler2).
14. Define a function named test().
15. In the test() function, create a loop that iterates 100 times.
16. In each iteration of the loop, log a message to the root logger using root_logger.info(""test"" + str(i)).
17. Define a function named test_config().
18. In the test_config() function, create a ConfigParser instance using configparser.ConfigParser().
19. Read the configuration file 'config.ini' using conf.read('config.ini', encoding='utf-8').
20. Get the values of the 'name' and 'password' keys in the 'login' section using conf.get('login', 'name') and conf.get('login', 'password').
21. If the values of 'name' and 'password' are 'name' and 'password' respectively, prompt the user to input their login name and password using input().
22. Set the 'name' and 'password' values in the 'login' section to the values entered by the user using conf.set('login', 'name', name) and conf.set('login', 'password', passwd).
23. Write the changes to the configuration file using with open('config.ini', 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f: conf.write(f).
24. Print the values of 'name' and 'password' using print(name) and print(passwd).
25. Call the test_config() function if the Rust file is being run as the main program using if __name__ == '__main__': test_config()."

2. Create an instance of the Watcher class, passing in an environment object as an argument.

3. Call the addLayers method on the Watcher instance, passing in a LayerCollection object that contains the Git repositories you want to monitor.

4. Call the start method on the Watcher instance to start the monitoring process. You can optionally pass in an interval argument to specify how often the Watcher should check for changes (default is 30 seconds).

5. If you want to stop the monitoring process, call the stop method on the Watcher instance.

6. If you want to manually trigger a check for changes, call the trigger method on the Watcher instance.

7. If you want to wait for changes to occur, call the wait method on the Watcher instance. This method will block until a change occurs.

8. If a change occurs, you can retrieve the updated LayerCollection object by calling the getnext method on the Watcher instance. This method will return a tuple containing the original LayerCollection object, the updated LayerCollection object, and the time the change occurred."
