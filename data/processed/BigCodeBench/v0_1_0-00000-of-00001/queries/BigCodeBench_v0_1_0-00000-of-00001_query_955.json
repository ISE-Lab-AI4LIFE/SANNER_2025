  "text": "Generate sentences with spaces in certain target words replaced by underscores.\nNote that: Notes: Each sentence is generated by randomly sampling 10 words with replacement from a vocabulary, then concatenating with a single whitespace. Then, if any words from the target_words list appear in these sentences, spaces within those words are replaced with underscores; here the modification is insensitive to the case of the letters. The function returns the processed sentences as a list of all lowercase strings.\nThe function should raise the exception for: ValueError: If n_sentences is negative or if the vocabulary is empty.\nThe function should output with:\n    list of str: A list of generated sentences in all lowercase, with specified words/phrases underscored.\nYou should write self-contained code starting with:\n```\nimport random\nimport re\ndef task_func(target_words, n_sentences, vocabulary):\n```"
