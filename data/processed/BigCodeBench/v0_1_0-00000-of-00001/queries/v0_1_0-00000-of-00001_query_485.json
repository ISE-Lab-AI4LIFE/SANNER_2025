  "text": "Generate a DataFrame with detailed artificial sensor readings for specified timestamps and sensor statuses from a predefined list. The function generates sensor readings for Sensor1, Sensor2, and Sensor3 (or their corresponding named columns in the supplied column list) using sine, cosine, and tan functions, respectively, of the timestamp (converted to seconds), with a small random noise added to simulate real sensor data variability. SensorStatus is randomly chosen from the provided statuses for each timestamp.\nThe function should output with:\n    pd.DataFrame: Generated sensor readings for the given timestamps.\nYou should write self-contained code starting with:\n```\nimport math\nimport numpy as np\nfrom datetime import datetime\nimport pandas as pd\ndef task_func(\n    start_time,\n    end_time,\n    step,\n    columns=[\"Timestamp\", \"Sensor1\", \"Sensor2\", \"Sensor3\", \"SensorStatus\"],\n    sensor_statuses=[\"OK\", \"MAINTENANCE_REQUIRED\", \"ERROR\"],\n    random_seed=42,\n):\n```"
