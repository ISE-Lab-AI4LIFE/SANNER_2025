  "text": "Alternates elements from two numeric lists, calculates the absolute difference of each element from a predefined threshold, and returns the element closest to this threshold.\nNote that: Notes: If l1 and l2 are of different lengths, elements from the longer list without a corresponding pair in the shorter list will not be paired with 'None'. Only existing numeric elements are considered. The threshold is fixed at 0.5. Adjustments to the threshold require changes to the THRESHOLD constant.\nThe function should output with:\n    float: The element from the combined list that is closest to the threshold of 0.5.\nYou should write self-contained code starting with:\n```\nimport numpy as np\nfrom itertools import zip_longest\ndef task_func(l1, l2,THRESHOLD = 0.5):\n```"
