  "text": "Generates a DataFrame with multiple random integer time series (each ranging from 0 to 100) from a start date to an end date, then returns the generated time series on a line plot.\nNote that: Notes: The line plot's title is set to \"Random Time Series\", the x-axis label to \"Date\", and the y-axis label to \"Value\". Each time series is plotted as a separate line with automatic coloring and legend entry labeled as \"series_x\" where x is the series number.\nThe function should raise the exception for: ValueError: If start_date is later than end_date; or if num_series is less than 1.\nThe function should output with:\n    pandas.DataFrame: A pandas DataFrame containing the generated time series, indexed by date.\n    plt.Axes: A matplotlib line plot of the time series.\nYou should write self-contained code starting with:\n```\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom datetime import datetime\nimport random\ndef task_func(start_date, end_date, num_series, seed=None):\n```"
