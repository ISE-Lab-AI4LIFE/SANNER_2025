  "text": "Generate a Pandas DataFrame of products with their ID, quantity, code, price, product, and description based on a specified string of product data. The input string is expected to be divided into segments by newlines. Each segment is expected to be further split into parts by whitespace: ID, quantity, code, price, and a product description. The function will remove trailing whitespaces in each field and assign a product name per unique code. Product name is randomly sampled from: ['Apple', 'Banana', 'Orange', 'Pear', 'Grape']. The same product name will be assigned to each code for each input s, however different codes can be mapped to the same name. >>> s = '1 10 A10B 100 This is a description with spaces\\\\n2 20 B20C 200 Another description example' >>> df = task_func(s) >>> df ID  Quantity  Code  Price Product                        Description 0  1        10  A10B    100    Pear  This is a description with spaces 1  2        20  B20C    200    Pear        Another description example\nThe function should output with:\n    data_df (pd.DataFrame): DataFrame with columns: ['ID', 'Quantity', 'Code', 'Price', 'Product', 'Description'].\n    Quantity and Price are expected to be integers.\nYou should write self-contained code starting with:\n```\nimport pandas as pd\nimport re\nimport random\ndef task_func(s: str, seed: int = 0) -> pd.DataFrame:\n```"
