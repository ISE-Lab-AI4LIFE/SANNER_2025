  "text": "This function reads data from a CSV file, normalizes a specific column named 'column1', and then plots the normalized data. - The title is created using Python's string formatting, aligning 'Plot Title' and 'Normalized Column 1' on either side of a colon, each padded to 20 characters. - Similarly, the x-label is formatted with 'Index' and 'Normalized Value' on either side of a colon, each padded to 20 characters. - The y-label is set in the same manner, with 'Frequency' and 'Normalized Value' on either side of a colon.\nThe function should output with:\n    The matplotlib.axes.Axes object with the plot of the normalized data.\nYou should write self-contained code starting with:\n```\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\ndef task_func(csv_file_path: str):\n```"
