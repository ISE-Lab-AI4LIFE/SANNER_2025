The function selects category from ['Electronics', 'Clothing', 'Home', 'Books', 'Sports']. Each day's sales are randomly determined between 10 and 50 units for each category. The plot's x-axis represents 'Days since (the start date)', and the y-axis represents 'Sales' units.\nThe function should raise the exception for: ValueError: If the start time is negative or after the current time.\nThe function should output with:\n    sales_data (dict): Sales data for different categories over days.\n    ax (plt.Axes): The plot depicting the sales trend.\nYou should write self-contained code starting with:\n```\nimport random\nfrom datetime import datetime\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\ndef task_func(epoch_milliseconds, seed=None):\n```"
