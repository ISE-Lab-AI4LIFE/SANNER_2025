  "text": "Draws the linear equation y = 2x + 1 on a 2D plot for x values ranging from -10 to 10, and marks the solution for x = 2 with a green 'o' (circle) marker. The plot includes: - A red line representing the equation y = 2x + 1, labeled as 'y=2x+1', for x in [-10, 10]. - A green circle marker indicating the solution at x = 2, y = 5. - Title: 'Solution of the equation y=2x+1 at x=2' - X-axis labeled as 'x', with a range from -10 to 10. - Y-axis labeled as 'y', with a range automatically adjusted based on the equation. - A legend indicating labels for the equation and the solution point.\nThe function should output with:\n    matplotlib.axes.Axes: An object representing the plot with specified features and ranges.\nYou should write self-contained code starting with:\n```\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\ndef task_func():\n```"
