  "text": "Simulates a delay and then returns a message indicating the elapsed time. This is repeated for a specified number of iterations. For each iteration the delay is randomly sampled from a uniform distribution specified by min_delay and max_delay. After each iteration the message: '{delay} seconds have passed', where {delay} is replaces with the actual delay of the iteration with 2 positions after the decimal point, is saved to an array.
