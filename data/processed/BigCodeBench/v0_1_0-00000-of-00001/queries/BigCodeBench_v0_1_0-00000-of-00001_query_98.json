  "text": "Generates all possible combinations of the provided numbers in a given list for each possible length. For each combination, it computes the product of the numbers in the combination. It then computes the logarithm of each product and sums these logarithms to produce the final result.\nThe function should output with:\n    float: The sum of the logarithms of the products of all combinations of numbers.\nYou should write self-contained code starting with:\n```\nimport math\nimport itertools\nfrom functools import reduce\ndef task_func(numbers):\n```"
