  "text": "Trains a RandomForestRegressor model and returns the mean squared error (MSE) of the predictions and the model. First the data is converted into a pandas DataFrame and then split into a train and test set. The fractional size of the test set is determined by 'test_size'. Then a RandomForestRegressor is trained on the data, using the in 'target' specified column as target. The MSE on the test set is calculated.\nThe function should raise the exception for: ValueError: If the input DataFrame is empty or the target column name is not in the DataFrame.\nThe function should output with:\n    float: The mean squared error of the model's predictions on the test set.\n    RandomForestRegressor: The trained model.\n    DataFrame: The converted dictionary input data.\nYou should write self-contained code starting with:\n```\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor\nfrom sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error\ndef task_func(data, target, test_size=0.2, random_state=None):\n```"
