After calculating the difference, calculate the entropy of the differences.\nThe function should output with:\n    np.ndarray: A numpy array containing the difference between the ASCII values of each pair of adjacent letters in the word.\n    float: The entropy of the differences.\nYou should write self-contained code starting with:\n```\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy import stats\ndef task_func(word: str) -> np.ndarray:\n```"
