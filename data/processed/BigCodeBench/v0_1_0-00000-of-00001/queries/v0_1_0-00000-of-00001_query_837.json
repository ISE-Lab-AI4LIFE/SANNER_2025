The above example assumes that '332' is found at index 10 in 'file1.csv' and index 15 in 'file2.csv' and that the file moving is simulated.\nThe function should output with:\n    result (dict): A dictionary with file names as keys and the row indices as values where the target value was found.\nYou should write self-contained code starting with:\n```\nimport os\nimport shutil\nimport csv\ndef task_func(target_value='332', csv_dir='./csv_files/', processed_dir='./processed_files/', simulate=False):\n```"
