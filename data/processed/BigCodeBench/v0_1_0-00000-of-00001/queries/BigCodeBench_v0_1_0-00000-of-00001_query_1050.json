  "text": "Process a multi-line string by replacing tabs with spaces and converting it into a pandas DataFrame. Each non-empty line of the input string is transformed into a separate row in the DataFrame. The function specifically filters out empty lines and replaces tabs with single spaces in the remaining lines.\nNote that: The function excludes lines that are empty or contain only whitespace. Tabs within the lines are replaced with a single space. For instance, a '\\\\t' character in the input string will be replaced by ' ' in the output DataFrame.\nThe function should output with:\n    pd.DataFrame: A DataFrame with a single column named 'Text'. Each row in this column corresponds to a non-empty\n    line from the input string, with tabs replaced by spaces.\nYou should write self-contained code starting with:\n```\nimport re\nimport pandas as pd\ndef task_func(input_string: str) -> pd.DataFrame:\n```"
