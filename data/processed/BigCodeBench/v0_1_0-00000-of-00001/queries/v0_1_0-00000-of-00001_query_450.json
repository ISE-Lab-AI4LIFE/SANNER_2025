  "text": "This function takes a pandas DataFrame and standardizes its features using sklearn's StandardScaler, which standardizes features by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance. After standardization, it draws a histogram for each feature with 20 bins.\nThe function should output with:\n    standardized_data (pd.DataFrame): The standardized data.\n    axes_list (list): A list of matplotlib Axes objects representing the histograms for each feature.\nYou should write self-contained code starting with:\n```\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\ndef task_func(data: pd.DataFrame) -> (pd.DataFrame, list):\n```"
