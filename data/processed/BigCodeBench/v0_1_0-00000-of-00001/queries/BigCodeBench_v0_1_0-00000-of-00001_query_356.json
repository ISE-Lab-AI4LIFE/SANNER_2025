  "text": "Generates and plots a complex wave with a specified amplitude and frequency over given time points, applying a Hann window to reduce edge effects. The wave is represented as a complex number where the real part is the cosine component, and the imaginary part is the sine component. It returns both the wave and the plot object.\nNote that: Notes: The plot title is \"Complex Wave with Hann Window\". The x-label of the plot is \"Time\". The y-label of the plot is \"Amplitude\". The plot displays both the real and imaginary parts of the complex wave.\nThe function should output with:\n    numpy.ndarray: The generated complex wave as a numpy array of complex numbers.\n    matplotlib.figure.Figure: The figure object of the plot.\n    matplotlib.axes.Axes: The axes object of the plot.\nYou should write self-contained code starting with:\n```\nimport numpy as np\nimport math\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom scipy.signal import get_window\ndef task_func(amplitude, frequency, time):\n```"
