  "text": "Executes a script to produce a CSV, reads the CSV, and plots a bar graph from the data. This function runs the provided script, which should generate a CSV file at the specified output path. The CSV must have exactly two columns. It then reads this CSV into a DataFrame and plots a bar graph, setting the first column as the x-axis labels and the second column as the bar heights. It will raise ValueError if the script fails to execute, or if the produced CSV is not valid.\nThe function should raise the exception for: ValueError: If the script fails to execute, the CSV is invalid, or the CSV does not contain exactly 2 columns.\nThe function should output with:\n    df (pd.DataFrame): DataFrame containing the data from the CSV.\n    ax (matplotlib.axes._axes.Axes): Axes object of the plotted bar graph.\nYou should write self-contained code starting with:\n```\nimport subprocess\nimport pandas as pd\ndef task_func(script_path, output_file_path):\n```"
