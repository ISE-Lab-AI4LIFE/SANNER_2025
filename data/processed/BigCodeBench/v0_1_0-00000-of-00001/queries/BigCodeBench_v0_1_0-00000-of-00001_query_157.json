The function also visualizes these averages in a plot.\nThe function should output with:\n    DataFrame: A pandas DataFrame where data is normalized, with an additional column 'Average' representing the\n    mean of each row.\n    Axes: A matplotlib Axes object showing a bar subplot of the average values across the dataset.\nYou should write self-contained code starting with:\n```\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\ndef task_func(data):\n```"
