  "text": "Calculate statistics for the vegetables preferred by people listed in the input dictionary. The function reverses the dictionary to map vegetables to people and assigns random counts to these vegetables. It then calculates the occurrences of each vegetable as a percentage of the total counts. A dictionary is created to map each vegetable to a person from the input where vegetables are values. Random counts between 1 and 10 are assigned to simulate varying popularity or availability of each vegetable.\nThe function should output with:\n    DataFrame: Returns a DataFrame with columns for vegetable names, their random counts,\n    and their percentage occurrence within the total counts.\nYou should write self-contained code starting with:\n```\nimport random\nimport pandas as pd\nimport collections\n# Constants\nVEGETABLES = ['Carrot', 'Potato', 'Tomato', 'Cabbage', 'Spinach']\ndef task_func(vegetable_dict, seed=0):\n```"
