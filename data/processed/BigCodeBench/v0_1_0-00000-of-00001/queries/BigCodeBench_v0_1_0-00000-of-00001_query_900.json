  "text": "Generates a random walk of a specified length. A random walk is a path that consists of a series of random steps on some mathematical space. In this case, the steps are either +1 or -1, chosen with equal probability.\nThe function should raise the exception for: ValueError: If `length` is negative.\nThe function should output with:\n    np.array: A numpy array representing the positions of the walk at each step. Starts at 0.\nYou should write self-contained code starting with:\n```\nimport numpy as np\nimport random\ndef task_func(length=10000, seed=0):\n```"
