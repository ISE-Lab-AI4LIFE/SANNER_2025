  "text": "The function creates an HTTP POST request handler for processing incoming data. The data is expected to be in JSON format with a key 'data'. The handler responds with a 200 success message if the data is valid, or an error message otherwise.\nNote that: Notes: If the 'Content-Type' header is not 'application/json', the server responds with a 400 Bad Request status and a JSON object: {\"status\": \"error\", \"message\": \"Content-Type header is not application/json\"}. If the received JSON object does not contain a 'data' key, the response is a 400 Bad Request with a JSON object: {\"status\": \"error\", \"message\": \"No data received\"}. For successfully processed requests, the server responds with a 200 OK status and a JSON object: {\"status\": \"success\", \"message\": \"Data received successfully.\"}.\nThe function should output with:\n    class: A class that is a subclass of http.server.BaseHTTPRequestHandler, designed to handle HTTP POST requests.\nYou should write self-contained code starting with:\n```\nimport cgi\nimport http.server\nimport json\ndef task_func():\n```"
