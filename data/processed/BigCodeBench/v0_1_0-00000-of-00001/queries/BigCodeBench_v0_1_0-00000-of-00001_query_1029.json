  "text": "Monitors and logs CPU usage at specified intervals over a given duration.\nNote that: Actual run time of the function may slightly exceed the specified 'duration' due to processing time and system response delay. The function records the CPU usage percentage at regular intervals for a specified duration. The data is captured every 'interval' seconds until the 'duration' is reached or exceeded. Each record includes a timestamp and the CPU usage percentage at that moment. The data is saved in JSON format in a log file named 'logfile.log'. The function supports different commands for CPU usage monitoring on Windows and Unix/Linux platforms.\nThe function should raise the exception for: ValueError: If either 'interval' or 'duration' is less than or equal to zero.\nThe function should output with:\n    str: Path to the log file where CPU usage data is saved. Returns None if an IOError occurs during file operations.\nYou should write self-contained code starting with:\n```\nimport subprocess\nimport time\nimport json\nimport platform\nLOGFILE_PATH = \"logfile.log\"\ndef task_func(interval, duration):\n```"
