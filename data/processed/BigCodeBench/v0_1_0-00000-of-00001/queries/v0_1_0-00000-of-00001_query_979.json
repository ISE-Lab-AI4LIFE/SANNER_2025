An named but empty DataFrame is returned for arrays without features or with empty content.\nThe function should raise the exception for: ValueError: If the input array is not 2D.\nThe function should output with:\n    pandas.DataFrame: DataFrame with columns 'PC1' and 'PC2' representing the two principal components.\nYou should write self-contained code starting with:\n```\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom sklearn.decomposition import PCA\ndef task_func(array, seed=None):\n```"
