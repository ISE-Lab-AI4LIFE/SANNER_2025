  "text": "Generate a series of n sine waves with increasing frequency with a fidelity of 0.01 radians as provided by the ANGLES array. The amplitude of each wave is 1. The function returns a list of numpy arrays with the y values of the sine waves. Additionally, calculate the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of the mixed signal and plot the histogram of the magnitude of the FFT data. If n_waves is less than 1, return an empty list for the sine waves, an empty array for the FFT data, and None for the axes object.\nThe function should output with:\n    list: A list of numpy arrays with the y values of the sine waves.\n    np.array: FFT data.\n    plt.Axes: The axes object of the plot.\nYou should write self-contained code starting with:\n```\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom scipy.fft import fft\nANGLES = np.arange(0, 2*np.pi, 0.01)\ndef task_func(n_waves, seed=0):\n```"
