  "text": "Calculate and return the total and average counts for each type of fruit. This function takes a list of tuples, each containing a fruit name and its count, then calculates the total count and the average count for each type of fruit. The results are returned as a pandas DataFrame with each row representing a different fruit. If fruit_data is an empty list, an empty dataFrame is returned. >>> fruit = [('apple', 1), ('orange', 25), ('apple', 111)] >>> df = task_func(fruit) >>> df.sort_index(inplace=True) >>> print(df) Total Count  Average Count apple           112           56.0 orange           25           25.0\nThe function should output with:\n    DataFrame: A pandas DataFrame with two columns: 'Total Count' and 'Average Count'.\n    Each row's index is the fruit name.\nYou should write self-contained code starting with:\n```\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\ndef task_func(fruit_data):\n```"
