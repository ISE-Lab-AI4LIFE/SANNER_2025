  "text": "Filter the prime numbers from the specified list, sort the prime numbers ascending based on their radian value converted to degrees, and return the sorted list. The function uses the isprime function from the sympy library to determine prime numbers and the degrees function from the math library to sort the numbers based on their degree value. >>> task_func([101, 102, 103, 104]) [101, 103]\nThe function should output with:\n    list[int]: A sorted list of prime numbers based on their degree value.\nYou should write self-contained code starting with:\n```\nimport math\nfrom sympy import isprime\ndef task_func(input_list):\n```"
