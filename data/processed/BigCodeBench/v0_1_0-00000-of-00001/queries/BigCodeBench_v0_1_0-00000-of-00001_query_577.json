  "text": "Generate a Series from a list \"l\". The function shuffles the list, then creates a longer series by cycling through the shuffled list. For each element in the series, it randomly selects n_groups characters from the start of the string and moves them to the end.\nThe function should output with:\n    pd.Series: A Series where each element is modified by moving \"n\"\n    characters from the start to the end.\nYou should write self-contained code starting with:\n```\nfrom random import shuffle, randint\nimport pandas as pd\ndef task_func(l, n_groups = 5):\n```"
