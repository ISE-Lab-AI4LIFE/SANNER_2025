  "text": "Creates and displays a diagram of a parabola represented by the equation y = x^2. The function plots the parabola using matplotlib, sets the title as 'y = x^2', labels the axes as 'x' and 'y', and enables the grid. It uses a fixed range for x values from -10 to 10 with 400 points. This function is used for demonstrating basic plotting capabilities and visualizing quadratic functions. The function does not take any parameters and does not return any value.\nThe function should output with:\n    None\nYou should write self-contained code starting with:\n```\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\ndef task_func():\n```"
