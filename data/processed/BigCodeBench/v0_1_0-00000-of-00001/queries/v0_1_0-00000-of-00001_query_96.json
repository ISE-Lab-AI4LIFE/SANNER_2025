  "text": "Generates a DataFrame with simulated monthly sales data for various product categories, ensuring reproducibility through the use of a random seed.\nNote that: Notes: The function sets the random seed at the beginning of execution to ensure that the generated sales data is the same for any given seed value. The sales data for each category is generated for each month, creating a comprehensive report that spans all specified categories and months.\nThe function should raise the exception for: ValueError: If either 'categories' or 'months' is not provided as a list or if either is an empty list.\nThe function should output with:\n    pandas.DataFrame: A DataFrame with three columns: 'Month', 'Category', and 'Sales'. The 'Sales' values are floating-point numbers in the range [100, 501), generated by the formula: randint(100, 500) + uniform(0, 1), ensuring sales values are diverse yet consistent upon repeated executions with the same seed.\nYou should write self-contained code starting with:\n```\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom random import randint, uniform, seed\ndef task_func(categories=None, months=None, random_seed=42):\n```"
