This function iterates from the starting epoch time to the current system time, incrementally increasing the time by a random number of seconds (an integer in [1, 10]) between each log entry. Each log entry records a user performing an activity at a specific time.\nThe function should raise the exception for: ValueError: If the start time is after the current system time.\nThe function should output with:\n    pd.DataFrame: A DataFrame containing logs of user activities, with columns:\n    'User':   User names, randomly chosen from a predefined list of users,\n    ['user1', 'user2', 'user3', 'user4', 'user5'].\n    'Activity': Activities performed by the users, randomly chosen from a\n    predefined list of activities, ['login', 'logout', 'browse',\n    'search', 'purchase'].\n    'Time': The timestamp of when the activity occurred, incrementally\n    increasing from the starting epoch time to the current time.\nYou should write self-contained code starting with:\n```\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\nimport random\ndef task_func(epoch_milliseconds, seed=0):\n```"
