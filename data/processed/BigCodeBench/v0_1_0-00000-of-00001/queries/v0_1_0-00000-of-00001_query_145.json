  "text": "Scans a specified IP address range and sends an HTTP GET request to each IP to verify if it is an active web server. The function requires an IP range in CIDR format (e.g., '192.168.0.0/16') and a timeout value in seconds. It returns a list of IPs where the request returned a status code of 200. If the request is not success, then ignore and continue to the next IP address.\nThe function should raise the exception for: ValueError: If an invalid IP range is provided.\nThe function should output with:\n    list: A list of IP addresses that responded with a status code of 200.\nYou should write self-contained code starting with:\n```\nimport ipaddress\nimport requests\ndef task_func(ip_range, timeout):\n```"
