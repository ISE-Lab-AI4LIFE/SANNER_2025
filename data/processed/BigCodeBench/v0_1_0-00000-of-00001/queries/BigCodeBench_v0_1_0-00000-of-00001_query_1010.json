The output CSV path should be a valid file path where the user has write permissions, to prevent IOError.\nThe function should raise the exception for: ET.ParseError: This exception is raised if the input XML content is malformed or cannot be successfully parsed. The exception message includes details about the parsing error. IOError: Raised if there is an issue with writing to the specified CSV file path. This can happen due to reasons like invalid file path, full disk space, lack of write permissions, etc. The exception message provides details about the IO error.\nThe function should output with:\n    None: The function does not return any value. Instead, it writes the output to\n    a CSV file at the specified path.\nYou should write self-contained code starting with:\n```\nimport xml.etree.ElementTree as ET\nimport csv\ndef task_func(xml_content, output_csv_path):\n```"
