The ranking is then sorted in descending order of points and returned as an OrderedDict.\nThe function should output with:\n    OrderedDict: Sorted dictionary where keys are team names and values are points.\nYou should write self-contained code starting with:\n```\nimport collections\nimport random\nfrom queue import PriorityQueue\ndef task_func(number_teams=5):\n```"
