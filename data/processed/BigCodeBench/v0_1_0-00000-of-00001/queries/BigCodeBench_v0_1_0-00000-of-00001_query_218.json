Returns the Axes object representing the plot and the empirical mean and standard deviation of the sample.\nThe function should output with:\n    ax (matplotlib.axes._axes.Axes): Axes object with the plotted histogram and normal PDF, with the title format of 'Normal Distribution with $\\\\mu = %0.2f, \\\\sigma = %0.2f$'.\n    float: The empirical mean of the sample.\n    float: The empirical standard deviation of the sample.\nYou should write self-contained code starting with:\n```\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy import stats\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\ndef task_func(mu=0, sigma=1, sample_size=1000, seed=0):\n```"
