  "text": "Compresses a given NumPy array using gzip compression and returns the compressed data. This method takes a NumPy array as input, compresses it using gzip, and returns the compressed data as bytes. It is useful for efficiently handling large datasets, especially when saving space is a concern. The function utilizes the struct module to pack the array elements into bytes before compressing them. The compressed data can then be used for storage or transmission purposes where space efficiency is crucial.\nThe function should output with:\n    bytes: The gzipped data of the NumPy array.\nYou should write self-contained code starting with:\n```\nimport struct\nimport io\nimport gzip\ndef task_func(newArray):\n```"
