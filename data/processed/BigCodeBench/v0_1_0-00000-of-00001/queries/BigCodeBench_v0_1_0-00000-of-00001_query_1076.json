  "text": "Compute the differences in seconds with integer values between consecutive datetime strings and plot these differences as a bar chart.\nNote that: The function requires the datetime, numpy, and matplotlib.pyplot modules. The datetime strings in the input list should follow the specific format specified in TIME_FORMAT. The function calculates the time differences between each pair of consecutive datetime strings in the list.\nThe function should output with:\n    matplotlib.axes.Axes: The axes object of the plotted bar chart. This object allows further customization of the plot outside this function.\nYou should write self-contained code starting with:\n```\nimport datetime\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n# Constants\nTIME_FORMAT = \"%d/%m/%y %H:%M:%S.%f\"\ndef task_func(time_strings):\n```"
