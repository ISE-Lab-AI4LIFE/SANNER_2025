  "text": "Converts string-formatted weights to floats and plots a scatter plot of weight against height. This function takes a dictionary with two keys: 'Weight_String' and 'Height'. The 'Weight_String' key should contain a list of weight values in string format, while the 'Height' key should have a list of corresponding height values in numerical format. If the input dictionary is not provided, the function uses a default dataset. The function then converts the string-formatted weights into float, and plots a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between weight and height.\nThe function should raise the exception for: ValueError: If any of the values in the 'Weight_String' key are not formatted as strings. This validation ensures that the weight data is in the expected format for conversion to float.\nThe function should output with:\n    ax (matplotlib.axes._axes.Axes): A scatter plot with weight on the x-axis and height on the y-axis, titled \"Weight vs Height\".\nYou should write self-contained code starting with:\n```\nimport pandas as pd\nimport seaborn as sns\ndef task_func(data=None):\n```"
