This function merges two dataframes via outer join on the 'id' column, and scales the merged dataframe's numeric features from df1 to have a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1. It also returns a pair plot of the scaled features from df1.\nThe function should output with:\n    merged_df (pd.DataFrame): The partially scaled and merged dataframe.\n    pair_plot (seaborn.axisgrid.PairGrid): Pair plot of the scaled dataframe.\nYou should write self-contained code starting with:\n```\nimport pandas as pd\nimport seaborn as sns\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\ndef task_func(df1, df2):\n```"
