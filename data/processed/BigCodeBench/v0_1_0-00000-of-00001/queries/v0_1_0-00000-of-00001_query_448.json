  "text": "Performs Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the provided dataset to reduce its dimensionality, and visualizes the results using a scatter plot. This function applies PCA to the dataset, reducing its features to the specified number of principal components. It then visualizes the reduced data in a scatter plot. For datasets reduced to a single component, the function generates a 1D scatter plot along the X-axis, with all Y-values set to zero. For reductions resulting in two or more components, only the first two principal components are visualized.\nThe function should output with:\n    dict: A dictionary containing:\n    \"transformed_data\" (np.ndarray): The transformed data.\n    \"ax\" (plt.Axes): The scatter plot visualizing the transformed data.\nYou should write self-contained code starting with:\n```\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.decomposition import PCA\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\ndef task_func(data, n_components=2, random_state=None):\n```"
