  "text": "Given a constant list of animals in ANIMALS, and a dictionary 'animal_dict' with keys as people's names and values as their favorite animal names, reverse the keys and values in a given dictionary and count the occurrences of each predefined animal name with a random count. Return the reversed dictionary and the counter with animal name occurrences. This function performs two tasks: 1. It reverses the given dictionary (animal_dict) such that the original values become keys and the original keys become lists of values. 2. It counts the occurrences of each animal name in a predefined list (ANIMALS). The count of each animal name is a random integer between 1 and max_count (inclusive).\nThe function should output with:\n    tuple: A tuple where the first element is a reversed dictionary and the second element is a counter with animal\n    name occurrences (with randomness in count).\nYou should write self-contained code starting with:\n```\nimport collections\nimport random\nimport itertools\nANIMALS = ['Cat', 'Dog', 'Elephant', 'Lion', 'Tiger', 'Bear', 'Giraffe', 'Horse', 'Rabbit', 'Snake', 'Zebra']\ndef task_func(animal_dict, max_count=10, seed=0):\n```"
