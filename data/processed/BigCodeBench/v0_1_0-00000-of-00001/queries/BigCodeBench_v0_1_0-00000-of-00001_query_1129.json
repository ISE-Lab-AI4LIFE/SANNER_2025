The JSON should contain a specific structure where the value to be hashed is under 'A' -> [unknown_key] -> 'maindata' -> [index 0] -> 'Info'.\nThe function should output with:\n    str: The absolute file path of the newly created file containing the hashed value.\nYou should write self-contained code starting with:\n```\nimport json\nimport os\nimport hashlib\nimport base64\nimport time\ndef task_func(file_path, unknown_key):\n```"
