  "text": "Calculate the product of a matrix \"P\" and a 3D tensor \"T\" with numpy and then apply PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the result. The resulting 2D data is then visualized.\nNote that: This function only accepts numpy matrices/arrays.\nThe function should output with:\n    pca_result (numpy.ndarray): The result of PCA of shape (N, 2), where N is the number of rows in matrix P.\n    ax (matplotlib.axes.Axes): Plot of 'PCA Result Visualization', with 'Principal Component 1' on the x-axis\n    and 'Principal Component 2' on the y-axis.\nYou should write self-contained code starting with:\n```\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.decomposition import PCA\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\ndef task_func(P, T, tensor_shape=(3, 3, 3)):\n```"
