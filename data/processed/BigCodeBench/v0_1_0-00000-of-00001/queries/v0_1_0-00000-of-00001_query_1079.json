  "text": "Analyzes the distribution of values in a NumPy array to determine if it is uniform and generates a histogram representing this distribution.\nNote that: The bin is set to `np.arange(len(unique) + 1) - 0.5` to align each bin with its corresponding unique value.\nThe function should output with:\n    tuple: A tuple containing two elements:\n    uniform_distribution (bool): A boolean value indicating whether the distribution is uniform.\n    Returns True if every unique value in the array appears the same number of times,\n    indicating a uniform distribution.\n    Returns False otherwise.\n    ax (matplotlib.axes.Axes): An Axes object displaying the histogram of the array's value distribution.\n    The histogram's bins correspond to the unique values in the array.\n    The frequency of each unique value is represented by the height of the corresponding bin.\nYou should write self-contained code starting with:\n```\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\ndef task_func(arr):\n```"
