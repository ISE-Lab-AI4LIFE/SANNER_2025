  "text": "This function processes a text dataset from a CSV file, performs text vectorization while excluding specific stopwords, and creates a histogram of the ten most common words. The function is robust to different input scenarios, such as empty data or data containing only stopwords.\nThe function should output with:\n    matplotlib Axes object: If save_path is not provided and valid words are found in the input, the function\n    displays the histogram plot and returns the matplotlib Axes object.\n    None: In two scenarios:\n    1. If save_path is provided, saves the plot to the specified location and returns None.\n    2. If the input file is empty or contains only stop words, prints a message and returns None.\nYou should write self-contained code starting with:\n```\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n# Constants\nSTOP_WORDS = [\"a\", \"an\", \"the\", \"in\", \"on\", \"at\", \"and\", \"or\"]\ndef task_func(file_path, save_path=None):\n```"
