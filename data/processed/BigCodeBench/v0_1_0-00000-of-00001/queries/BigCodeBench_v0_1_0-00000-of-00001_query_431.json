  "text": "Merge datasets, perform KMeans clustering, then return cluster labels and scatterplot. Each dataset is assumed to contain at least one id column and one feature column. The column to process is specified for df1 and df2 via column1 and column2, respectively. KMeans clustering is applied with k=2 and n_init=10. Resulting scatterplot shows column1 on the x-axis, column2 on the y-axis, and predicted cluster as color.\nThe function should output with:\n    labels (numpy.ndarray): Cluster labels for each data point (dtype=int32).\n    ax (matplotlib.axes._axes.Axes): The plotted figure's Axes object.\nYou should write self-contained code starting with:\n```\nfrom sklearn.cluster import KMeans\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\ndef task_func(df1, df2, column1=\"feature1\", column2=\"feature2\"):\n```"
