  "text": "Calculate the mean value of each row in a 2D data matrix, run a t-test from a sample against the population value, and record the mean values that differ significantly. - Create a lineplot with the mean of rows in red. Its label is 'Means'. - Create a line plot with the significant_indices (those with a pvalue less than ALPHA) on the x-axis and the corresponding means on the y-axis. This plot should be blue. Its label is 'Significant Means'. - Create an horizontal line which represent the mean computed on the whole 2D matrix. It should be in green. Its label is 'Population Mean'. Example 2: >>> data = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]) >>> indices, ax = task_func(data) >>> print(indices) []\nThe function should output with:\n    tuple: A tuple containing:\n    list: A list of indices of the means that are significantly different from the population mean.\n    Axes: The plot showing the means and significant means.\nYou should write self-contained code starting with:\n```\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.stats import ttest_1samp\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n# Constants\nALPHA = 0.05\ndef task_func(data_matrix):\n```"
