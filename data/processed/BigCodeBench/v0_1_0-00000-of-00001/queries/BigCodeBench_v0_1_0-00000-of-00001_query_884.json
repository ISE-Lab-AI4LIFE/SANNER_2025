  "text": "Determines if a specific subset of data is stationary by filtering rows where column_b bigger than 50 and column_c equal to 900. Data is considered to be stationary if the p_value returned by the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test is smaller than 0.05. If column_a is empty after filtering or if its values are constant, True is returned.\nThe function should output with:\n    bool: True if the data in column_a (after filtering based on column_b and column_c) is stationary, False otherwise.\nYou should write self-contained code starting with:\n```\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom statsmodels.tsa.stattools import adfuller\ndef task_func(df: pd.DataFrame, column_a: str, column_b: str, column_c: str) -> bool:\n```"
