  "text": "Generate a DataFrame representing monthly sales of products and visualize the total sales. The function creates a DataFrame where each row represents a month, each column represents a product, and cell values represent sales figures. It then plots the total sales per product across all months using both a line plot and a heatmap for visualization. The function also displays: - A line plot showing the total sales per product. - A heatmap visualizing sales figures across products and months.\nThe function should output with:\n    pd.DataFrame: A DataFrame with randomly generated sales figures for each product over 12 months.\nYou should write self-contained code starting with:\n```\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport seaborn as sns\nPRODUCTS = ['Product' + str(i) for i in range(1, 6)]\nMONTHS = ['Month' + str(i) for i in range(1, 13)]\ndef task_func():\n```"
