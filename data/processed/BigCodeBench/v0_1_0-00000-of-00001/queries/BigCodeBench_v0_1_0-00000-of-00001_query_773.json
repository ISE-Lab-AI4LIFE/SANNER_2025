  "text": "Generate a dataset consisting of random numbers sampled from a gaussian normal distribution that are transformed by applying a linear transformation. Standardize it with the StandardScaler of sklearn, and calculate the average square error between the original dataset and the standardized dataset. >>> mse = task_func() >>> print(mse) 19.03543917135251 >>> mse = task_func(k=1, d=0) >>> print(mse) 0.001113785307245742\nThe function should output with:\n    float: The mean squared error between the original and standardized data.\n    This value represents the average squared difference between each\n    original value and its standardized counterpart. The MSE can vary\n    significantly depending on the random seed and the specified\n    parameters of the linear transformation.\nYou should write self-contained code starting with:\n```\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\nfrom sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error\ndef task_func(num_samples=1000, k=5, d=2,  random_seed=None):\n```"
