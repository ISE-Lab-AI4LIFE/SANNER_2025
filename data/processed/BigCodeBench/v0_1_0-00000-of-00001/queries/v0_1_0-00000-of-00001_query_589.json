  "text": "Generates a DataFrame with two columns, 'X' and 'Y', each filled with random integers within a specified range, and plots these points using a scatter plot. The visualization is created using Seaborn on top of Matplotlib. The function is designed to be parameter-free for simplicity, utilizing constants for configuration. No Parameters.\nThe function should output with:\n    pd.DataFrame: A DataFrame with 'X' and 'Y' columns containing the generated random integers.\nYou should write self-contained code starting with:\n```\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n# Constants defining the range of random integers and the size of the DataFrame\nRANGE = 100\nSIZE = 1000\ndef task_func():\n```"
