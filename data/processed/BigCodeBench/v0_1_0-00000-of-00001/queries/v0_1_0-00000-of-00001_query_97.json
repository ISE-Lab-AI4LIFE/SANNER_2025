This function opens the specified CSV file using the provided delimiter, reads its contents, and counts the frequency of each word. It returns a list of tuples, each containing a word and its frequency, sorted by frequency in descending order.\nNote that: The function assumes that each cell in the CSV contains a single word.\nThe function should output with:\n    list of tuple: A list of tuples where each tuple contains a word and its count,\n    sorted by count in descending order.\nYou should write self-contained code starting with:\n```\nimport csv\nfrom collections import Counter\nimport operator\ndef task_func(csv_file, csv_delimiter):\n```"
