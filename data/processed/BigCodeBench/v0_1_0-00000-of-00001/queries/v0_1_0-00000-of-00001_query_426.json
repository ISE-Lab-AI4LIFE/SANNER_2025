The function also displays the original image and its histogram. The limit to the size of the image depends on the hardware capabilities of the system you are working on. A possible size of an image is 20x20.\nThe function should raise the exception for: FileNotFoundError: If the image file does not exist at the specified path.\nThe function should output with:\n    matplotlib.axes.Axes: The Axes object of the histogram plot.\nYou should write self-contained code starting with:\n```\nimport cv2\nimport os\nfrom matplotlib import pyplot as plt\ndef task_func(image_path='image.jpg', histogram_path='histogram.png'):\n```"
