  "text": "Processes a dictionary of numerical data to create a pandas DataFrame, removes None values, and generates a histogram of the data values using seaborn. The histogram's bins are dynamically calculated based on the range of the data. Specifically, the number of bins is set to the minimum of 11 and half the number of data points, with a minimum of 2 bins. If the DataFrame is empty or the data lacks variability (all values are the same after removing None values), the function does not generate a plot.\nNote that: Calculates the minimum and maximum values in the DataFrame. Dynamically sets the number of bins for the histogram based on the number of data points, with a minimum of 2 and a maximum of 11 bins. Create evenly spaced bin edges between the minimum and maximum values. KDE (Kernel Density Estimate) is turned off. Sets the plot title to the predefined constant `PLOT_TITLE`.\nThe function should output with:\n    DataFrame: A pandas DataFrame created from the input dictionary, excluding None values.\n    Axes or None: A seaborn histogram plot object if the DataFrame contains variable data;\n    None if the DataFrame is empty or if all values are identical.\nYou should write self-contained code starting with:\n```\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport seaborn as sns\n# Constants\nPLOT_TITLE = \"Value Distribution\"\ndef task_func(data_dict):\n```"
