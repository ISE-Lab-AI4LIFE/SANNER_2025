The plot title is set to 'Cumulative Sum per Column'. X-axis label is 'Index' and Y-axis label is 'Cumulative Sum'. A legend is included in the plot.\nThe function should raise the exception for: ValueError: If the DataFrame is empty or contains non-numeric data.\nThe function should output with:\n    tuple: A tuple containing:\n    (1) A DataFrame with cumulative sums for each column.\n    (2) A matplotlib bar chart Figure of these cumulative sums.\nYou should write self-contained code starting with:\n```\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\ndef task_func(df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:\n```"
