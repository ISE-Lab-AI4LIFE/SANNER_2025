The colors are selected from: 'red', 'yellow', 'green', 'blue', 'purple'. The function ensures that sales quantity must not be negative, throwing a ValueError if encountered.\nThe function should output with:\n    total_sales (dict): A dictionary containing the total sales for each fruit.\n    ax (matplotlib.container.BarContainer): A bar chart of total fruit sales, or None if data is empty\nYou should write self-contained code starting with:\n```\nimport collections\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\ndef task_func(data):\n```"
