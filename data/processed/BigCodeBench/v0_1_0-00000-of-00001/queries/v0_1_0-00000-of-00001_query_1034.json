  "text": "Generate all possible 3-letter combinations of the alphabet, save them in a pandas DataFrame, and draw a histogram of the frequency of the first letters in these combinations. This function uses itertools.product to create all possible combinations of three letters. It then creates a DataFrame from these combinations and plots a histogram to show the frequency of each letter appearing as the first letter in these combinations.\nThe function should output with:\n    tuple: A tuple containing:\n    DataFrame: A pandas DataFrame with all 3-letter combinations.\n    Axes: A matplotlib Axes object representing the histogram plot.\nYou should write self-contained code starting with:\n```\nimport itertools\nimport string\nimport pandas as pd\ndef task_func():\n```"
