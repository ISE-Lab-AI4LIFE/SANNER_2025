  "text": "Generate and plot a performance trend for different teams from a given epoch timestamp to the current time. The performance data is generated by creating a series of random values for each day from the starting timestamp to the present day. Each team's performance is simulated as a random float between 0.1 and 1 for each day. The plot shows days since the start date on the x-axis and performance on the y-axis.\nThe function should output with:\n    dict: A dictionary containing performance data for each team, with days as indices and performance as float values.\n    matplotlib.figure.Figure: A figure object showing the performance trend of each team over the days.\nYou should write self-contained code starting with:\n```\nfrom datetime import datetime\nimport random\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\ndef task_func(\n    epoch_milliseconds,\n    teams=[\"Team1\", \"Team2\", \"Team3\", \"Team4\", \"Team5\"],\n    random_seed=0,\n):\n```"
