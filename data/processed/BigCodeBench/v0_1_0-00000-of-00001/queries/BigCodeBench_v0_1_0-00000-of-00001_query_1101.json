  "text": "Processes a collection of text documents to compute the TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) scores for each word, excluding any URLs present in the texts. The TF-IDF scores help to identify the importance of a word within a document relative to a collection of documents.\nNote that: Notes: URLs in the text documents are removed before calculating TF-IDF scores to ensure they do not affect the analysis. The TF-IDF scores are rounded to 8 decimal places for precision.\nThe function should output with:\n    tuple of (list of tuples, list of str):\n    The first element is a list of tuples, each tuple representing a document with its words' TF-IDF scores in a\n    dense matrix format. Each score in the tuple corresponds to a word's TF-IDF score in the document.\n    The second element is a list of strings, representing the unique words (features) across all documents for\n    which TF-IDF scores have been calculated. The order of words in this list matches the order of scores in the\n    tuples of the first element.\nYou should write self-contained code starting with:\n```\nimport re\nfrom sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer\ndef task_func(texts):\n```"
