  "text": "Calculate the frequency of certain words in a text dictionary and return a bar chart's Axes object and a dictionary containing the frequencies of the top_k most common words in text_dict. The function takes a dictionary containing word frequencies and a list of words. It calculates the frequency of the provided words in the dictionary and returns the Axes object of the bar chart displaying the frequencies along with the top_k most common words and their frequencies as a dictionary. If a word in word_keys is not present in text_dict, its frequency is considered to be 0.\nThe function should raise the exception for: ValueError: If top_k is a negative integer.\nThe function should output with:\n    matplotlib.axes._axes.Axes: Axes object of the bar chart displaying the frequencies.\n    dict: Dictionary containing the frequencies of the top_k most common words. Key is the word and value is\n    its frequency.\nYou should write self-contained code starting with:\n```\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom collections import Counter\ndef task_func(text_dict, word_keys, top_k=2):\n```"
