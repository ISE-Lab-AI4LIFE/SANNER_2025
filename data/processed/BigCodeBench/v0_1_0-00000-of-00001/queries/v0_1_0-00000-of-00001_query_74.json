  "text": "Load e-mail data from an SQLite database and convert it into a Pandas DataFrame. Calculate the sum, mean, and variance of the list associated with each e-mail and then record these values. - The function expects the SQLite database to have a table named \"EmailData\" with columns 'email' and 'list'. - The column 'list' contains a string representation of the list. It should be converted before usage. - The function will return a DataFrame with additional columns 'sum', 'mean', and 'var' representing the calculated sum, mean, and variance respectively for each e-mail.\nThe function should output with:\n    tuple: A tuple containing:\n    DataFrame: A pandas DataFrame with email data including the calculated sum, mean, and variance.\n    Axes: A matplotlib Axes object representing the plotted bar chart of sum, mean, and variance.\nYou should write self-contained code starting with:\n```\nimport pandas as pd\nimport sqlite3\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport ast\ndef task_func(db_file):\n```"
