  "text": "This function generates and displays a bar chart representing random letter-number pairs. Each bar corresponds to a unique pair, formed by combining a letter from 'a' to 'z' with a number from 1 to 26. The function randomly shuffles these pairs and assigns a random count to each.\nNote that: Notes: Each call to this function will likely produce a different chart because it shuffles the order of the pairs and assigns random counts to them. The random counts assigned to each pair range from 1 to 9.\nThe function should raise the exception for: ValueError: If 'n_pairs' is outside the range of 1 to 26, inclusive. This ensures that the function operates within the bounds of the predefined letters ('a' to 'z') and numbers (1 to 26).\nThe function should output with:\n    matplotlib.container.BarContainer: This object represents the bar chart created by the function.\n    Each bar in the chart is labeled with its corresponding letter-number pair (e.g., 'a:1', 'b:2').\n    The title of the chart is \"Random Letter:Number Pairs Chart\", the x-axis label is \"Letter:Number Pairs\",\n    and the y-axis label is \"Counts\".\nYou should write self-contained code starting with:\n```\nimport numpy as np\nimport random\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n# Constants\nLETTERS = list(\"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\")\nNUMBERS = list(range(1, 27))\ndef task_func(n_pairs=26):\n```"
