  "text": "Generate and plot weather data for a specified date range. This function creates a DataFrame containing simulated daily weather data within the specified date range. It generates random values for temperature, humidity, and wind speed for each day. The function also plots these parameters over the date range and returns both the DataFrame and the plot object. The generated weather data ranges are as follows: - Temperature: Between -10°C and 40°C. - Humidity: Between 20% and 100%. - Wind Speed: Between 0 and 20 meters per second.\nThe function should raise the exception for: ValueError: If 'end_date' is before 'start_date', indicating an invalid date range.\nThe function should output with:\n    DataFrame: A pandas DataFrame with columns ['Date', 'Temperature', 'Humidity', 'Wind Speed'], containing the generated weather data for each day within the specified range.\n    Axes: A matplotlib Axes object of the plot showing the generated weather data.\nYou should write self-contained code starting with:\n```\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom datetime import timedelta\ndef task_func(start_date, end_date, random_seed=42):\n```"
