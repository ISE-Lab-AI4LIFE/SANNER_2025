  "text": "Generates a pandas DataFrame with two columns, \"Random Numbers\" and \"Moving Average,\" filled with random integers and their moving average, respectively. Additionally, this function plots a histogram of the \"Random Numbers\" column. No Parameters.\nThe function should output with:\n    pd.DataFrame: A DataFrame with two columns:\n    \"Random Numbers\": Contains a list of randomly generated integers.\n    \"Moving Average\": Contains the moving average of the random integers,\n    calculated over a window that includes the current\n    and previous 5 integers.\nYou should write self-contained code starting with:\n```\nimport pandas as pd\nimport random\nimport statistics\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\n# Constants\nRANGE = 10000  # The range within which random numbers are generated\nSIZE = 1000  # The number of random numbers to generate\nBIN_WIDTH = 100  # The width of bins for the histogram\ndef task_func():\n```"
