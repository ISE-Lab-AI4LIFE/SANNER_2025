  "text": "Generate a list of pandas Series objects, where each Series is indexed by the elements of a sub-list from `list_of_lists`. Each Series contains unique integers starting from 1 and going up to the length of the respective sub-list. These integers are shuffled randomly to create a unique ordering for each Series.\nNote that: The function uses numpy's random shuffle, which modifies the sequence in-place. Therefore, each call to the function may produce different Series values unless the random seed is set beforehand.\nThe function should output with:\n    series_list (list of pandas.Series): This function returns a list. Each element in this list is a pandas Series object.\n    The Series objects are indexed by the elements of the sub-lists provided in `list_of_lists`. The values in each Series\n    are unique integers that are randomly shuffled.\nYou should write self-contained code starting with:\n```\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\ndef task_func(list_of_lists):\n```"
