  "text": "Apply a random operation (remove, replace, shuffle, or randomize) to substrings in a list of strings. This function processes a list of comma-separated strings by applying one of four random operations to their substrings: remove, replace, shuffle, or randomize. Here, a substring refers to the individual items in the string that are separated by commas, sensitive to leading/trailing whitespace, i.e. 'apple' != 'apple ', and sensitive to case, i.e. 'APPLE' != 'aPPLE'. The choice of operation and the substrings it affects are determined randomly. The operations are: - Remove: Randomly selects and removes a substring. If a string contains only one substring, no 'remove' operation is applied. - Replace: Randomly selects a substring and replaces it with 'random_string'. - Shuffle: Randomly shuffles the order of the substrings. - Randomize: Assigns a new, random order to the substrings. Finally, the function returns a DataFrame with column 'Original String' containing the input strings and the 'Modified String' column containing the strings after applying the random operation.\nThe function should output with:\n    df (pd.DataFrame): DataFrame containing original and modified strings.\nYou should write self-contained code starting with:\n```\nimport pandas as pd\nimport random\nimport re\ndef task_func(data_list, seed=None):\n```"
