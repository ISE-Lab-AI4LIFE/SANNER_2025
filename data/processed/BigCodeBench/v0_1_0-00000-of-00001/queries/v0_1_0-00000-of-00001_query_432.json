  "text": "Creates a histogram of the pixel values of a grayscale image.\nNote that: The function assumes the image is in grayscale format. The histogram array is 1D with a size of 256, where each index corresponds to a pixel value, and the value at each index represents the count of pixels in the image with that pixel value.\nThe function should raise the exception for: FileNotFoundError: If the specified image file does not exist. ValueError: If the image file is not a valid image.\nThe function should output with:\n    np.ndarray: A 1D numpy array representing the histogram of the image, with 256 bins corresponding to\n    the pixel values in the range [0, 256). Each entry in the array represents the frequency of a pixel value\n    in the grayscale image.\nYou should write self-contained code starting with:\n```\nimport cv2\nimport os\nimport numpy as np\ndef task_func(image_file: str) -> np.ndarray:\n```"
