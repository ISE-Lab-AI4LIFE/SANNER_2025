  "text": "Process the given dictionary by performing the following operations: 1. Add a key \"a\" with a value of 1. 2. Generate a random salt of length 5 using lowercase ASCII letters. 3. For each key-value pair in the dictionary, concatenate the value with the generated salt, hash the concatenated string using SHA-256, and update the value with the hashed string. 4. Add a 'timestamp' key with the current UNIX timestamp as its value.\nThe function should output with:\n    dict: The processed dictionary with the hashed values and added keys.\nYou should write self-contained code starting with:\n```\nimport random\nimport string\nimport hashlib\nimport time\ndef task_func(data_dict: dict, seed=0) -> dict:\n```"
