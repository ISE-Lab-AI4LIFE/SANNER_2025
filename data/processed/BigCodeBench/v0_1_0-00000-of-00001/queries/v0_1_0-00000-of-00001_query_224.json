  "text": "This function preprocesses a pandas DataFrame by replacing specified values, encoding categorical attributes, and standardizing numerical attributes. It's designed to be flexible for data preprocessing in machine learning tasks.\nNote that: The function assumes that the DataFrame and the dictionary are well-formed and relevant to each other. The encoding of categorical columns is done using LabelEncoder, which encodes labels with value between 0 and n_classes-1. Numerical standardization is performed by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation of each column.\nThe function should raise the exception for: The function will raise a ValueError is input df is not a DataFrame.\nThe function should output with:\n    DataFrame: The preprocessed DataFrame with encoded categorical attributes and standardized numerical attributes.\nYou should write self-contained code starting with:\n```\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder\ndef task_func(df, dct, columns=None):\n```"
