  "text": "Generates a DataFrame with a specified number of rows and columns, populated with randomly generated data. Each column's data type is randomly selected from a set of Python data types, including primitive and complex structures. DataFrame: A DataFrame in which each column's data type could be one of the following, with random content generated accordingly: - str: Random strings of 5 lowercase alphabetic characters. - int: Random integers from 0 to 9. - float: Random floats derived by converting integers from 0 to 9 into float. - list: Lists of random length (1 to 5) containing integers from 0 to 9. - tuple: Tuples of random length (1 to 5) containing integers from 0 to 9. - dict: Dictionaries with a random number (1 to 5) of key-value pairs, keys and values are integers from 0 to 9. - set: Sets of random size (1 to 5) containing unique integers from 0 to 9.\nThe function should output with:\n    pd.DataFrame: A DataFrame with the specified number of rows and columns named 'col0', 'col1', etc., containing randomly generated data.\nYou should write self-contained code starting with:\n```\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nfrom random import choice\n# Constants\nDATA_TYPES = [str, int, float, list, tuple, dict, set]\ndef task_func(rows, columns):\n```"
