Updates the input dictionary by adding a key 'a' with the value 1. 2. Sorts the dictionary by the frequency of its values in descending order. 3. Backs up all files from the specified source directory to a backup directory. >>> data_dict = {'avc': '1', 'hello': 'world', 'test': 'world', 'cat': 'meow'} >>> updated_dict, value_frequencies, backup_status = task_func(data_dict, 'to_backup', 'backup') >>> print(updated_dict) {'a': 1, 'avc': '1', 'hello': 'world', 'test': 'world', 'cat': 'meow'} >>> print(value_frequencies) [('avc', 1), ('world', 2), ('meow', 1), (1, 2)] >>> print(backup_status) True\nThe function should output with:\n    tuple:\n    dict: The modified dictionary with the added key and value.\n    list: A list of tuples representing the sorted items of the dictionary by their frequency.\n    bool: A boolean indicating whether the backup was successful (True) or not (False).\nYou should write self-contained code starting with:\n```\nimport collections\nimport operator\nimport os\nimport shutil\ndef task_func(data_dict, source_directory, backup_directory):\n```"
