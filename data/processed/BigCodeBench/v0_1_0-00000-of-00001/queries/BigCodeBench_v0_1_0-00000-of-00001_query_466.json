  "text": "Serializes an object to a JSON string, handling complex data types through a custom JSONEncoder. This function is capable of serializing data types such as datetime, numpy.ndarray, and Decimal which are not natively supported by the default JSON serialization mechanisms. Serialize a simple dictionary. >>> task_func({'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30}) '{\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 30}'\nThe function should raise the exception for: TypeError: If an object of an unsupported type is encountered that cannot be serialized by both the custom and default JSON encoders. This ensures that users are made aware of serialization limitations for types not explicitly handled.\nThe function should output with:\n    str: The serialized JSON string of the object.\nYou should write self-contained code starting with:\n```\nimport json\nfrom datetime import datetime\nimport numpy as np\nfrom decimal import Decimal\ndef task_func(my_obj):\n```"
