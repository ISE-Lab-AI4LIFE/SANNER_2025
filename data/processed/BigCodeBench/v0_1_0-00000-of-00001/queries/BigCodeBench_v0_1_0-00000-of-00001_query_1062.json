  "text": "Plots a histogram of normalized data from an input 2D numpy array alongside the probability density function (PDF) of a standard normal distribution.\nNote that: Takes in a 2D numpy array as input. Calculates the sum of elements in each row of the array. Normalizes these row sums to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. Normalization is achieved by first calculating the mean and standard deviation of the row sums. Each row sum is then transformed by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation. If the standard deviation is 0 (indicating all row sums are equal), normalization results in an array of zeros with the same shape. Plots a histogram of the normalized data. Uses 30 bins for the histogram. The histogram is density-based, meaning it represents the probability density rather than raw frequencies. The bars of the histogram are semi-transparent (60% opacity) and green in color. Overlays the PDF of a standard normal distribution on the histogram for comparison. The PDF curve is plotted in red with a line width of 2. The range of the PDF curve is set to cover 99% of a standard normal distribution. Sets the title of the plot to \"Histogram of Normalized Data with Standard Normal PDF\".\nThe function should output with:\n    A tuple containing:\n    A matplotlib Axes object with the histogram of the normalized data and the overlaid standard normal PDF.\n    The normalized data as a 1D numpy array.\nYou should write self-contained code starting with:\n```\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom scipy.stats import norm\ndef task_func(arr: np.ndarray) -> (plt.Axes, np.ndarray):\n```"
