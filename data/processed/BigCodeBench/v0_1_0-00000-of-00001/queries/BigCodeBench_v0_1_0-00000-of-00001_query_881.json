  "text": "Perform K-Means clustering on the given DataFrame using the sklearn KMeans algorithm. The function expects a DataFrame with numerical values, as KMeans cannot handle categorical data. It applies standard KMeans clustering from the sklearn library to form clusters. The number of clusters is configurable via the 'n_clusters' parameter, defaulting to 3. The Number of times the k-means algorithm is run with different centroid seeds (n_init) is set to 10. The function returns an array of cluster labels corresponding to each data point in the input as well as the fitted KMeans model. >>> data = pd.DataFrame({ ...     'a': [1, 20, 2, 22, 100], ...     'b': [1, 20, 2, 22, 100] ... }) >>> labels, model = task_func(data, seed=213) >>> print(labels) [2 0 2 0 1] >>> print(model) KMeans(n_clusters=3, n_init=10, random_state=213)\nThe function should raise the exception for: ValueError: If the DataFrame contains non numeric entries.\nThe function should output with:\n    numpy.ndarray: An array of integers (cluster labels) corresponding to the input data. Each label is an integer\n    representing the cluster to which a row of data has been assigned.\n    sklearn.cluster.KMeans: The fitted KMeans Model.\nYou should write self-contained code starting with:\n```\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom sklearn.cluster import KMeans\ndef task_func(data, n_clusters=3, seed=None):\n```"
