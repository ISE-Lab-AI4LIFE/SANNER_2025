The size of the list equals the sum of these integers. Returns the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles of this list.\nThe function should output with:\n    tuple: A tuple (p25, p50, p75) representing the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles of the list.\nYou should write self-contained code starting with:\n```\nimport numpy as np\nimport itertools\nimport random\ndef task_func(T1, max_value=100):\n```"
