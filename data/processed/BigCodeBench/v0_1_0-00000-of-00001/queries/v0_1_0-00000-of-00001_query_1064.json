  "text": "Performs Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the sum of rows of a 2D numpy array and plots the explained variance ratio.\nNote that: The title of the plot is set to \"Explained Variance Ratio of Principal Components\". Notes: The function assumes that 'arr' is a valid 2D numpy array. Only the first principal component is considered in this analysis. The plot illustrates the proportion of the dataset's variance that lies along the axis of this first principal component.\nThe function should output with:\n    ax (matplotlib.axes.Axes): An Axes object from matplotlib.\nYou should write self-contained code starting with:\n```\nfrom matplotlib import pyplot as plt\nfrom sklearn.decomposition import PCA\ndef task_func(arr):\n```"
