It extracts substrings based on commas, removing leading and trailing whitespaces from each. Then, it shuffles these processed substrings within each string, and returns a pandas DataFrame with two columns: \"Original String\" and \"Shuffled String\".\nThe function should output with:\n    DataFrame: A pandas DataFrame with columns 'Original String' and 'Shuffled String'.\nYou should write self-contained code starting with:\n```\nimport re\nimport random\nimport pandas as pd\ndef task_func(data_list, seed=None):\n```"
