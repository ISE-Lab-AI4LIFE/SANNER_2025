  "text": "Calculate the product of a matrix \"P\" and a 3D tensor \"T\" with numpy and then visualize the result in 3D with matplotlib. The product of the matrix and tensor is based on the Einstein summation.\nNote that: This function only accepts numpy matrices/arrays.\nThe function should output with:\n    tuple:\n    result (numpy.ndarray): The product of matrix P and tensor T with shape (N, 3).\n    ax (mpl_toolkits.mplot3d.axes3d.Axes3D): The 3D visualization of the result.\nYou should write self-contained code starting with:\n```\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\ndef task_func(P, T):\n```"
