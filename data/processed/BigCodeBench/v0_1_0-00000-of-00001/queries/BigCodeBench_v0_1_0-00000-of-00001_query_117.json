  "text": "Generates a numpy array of random samples drawn from a normal distribution and plots the histogram of these samples. This function specifies the mean (mu), standard deviation (sigma), and sample size (sample_size), making it useful for simulating data, conducting statistical experiments, or initializing algorithms that require normally distributed data with visualization.\nNote that: Notes: Plots a histogram of the generated samples to show the distribution. The histogram features: X-axis labeled \"Sample values\", representing the value of the samples. Y-axis labeled \"Frequency\", showing how often each value occurs. Title \"Histogram of Generated Samples\", describing the content of the graph. Number of bins set to 30, to discretize the sample data into 30 intervals. Alpha value of 0.75 for bin transparency, making the histogram semi-transparent. Color 'blue', giving the histogram a blue color.\nThe function should output with:\n    ndarray: A numpy array of shape (sample_size,) containing samples drawn from the\n    specified normal distribution.\nYou should write self-contained code starting with:\n```\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\ndef task_func(mu, sigma, sample_size):\n```"
