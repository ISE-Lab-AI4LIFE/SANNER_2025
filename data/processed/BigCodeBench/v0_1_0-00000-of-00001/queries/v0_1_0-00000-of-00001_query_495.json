  "text": "Create a dictionary with a fake event schedule given an event time. The function converts a given epoch in milliseconds into a datetime object in the current system time's timezone. It generates a fake event name using Faker. Then, it uses pytz and regex to check if specified timezones are valid (i.e. in pytz.all_timezones or can be parsed using regex from UTC±HH:MM format), ignoring invalid ones. If none is valid or if timezones were not specified, it selects UTC; otherwise, it randomly selects a valid one using Faker. Finally, the function returns a dictionary with the fake event name as key and a list as value, where the list itself contains a schedule, i.e. a dictionary with keys 'date', 'time', 'timezone'.\nThe function should output with:\n    A dictionary containing event names as keys and a list of event details as values.\n    Event details include the date, time, and timezone of the event.\nYou should write self-contained code starting with:\n```\nfrom datetime import datetime\nimport pytz\nimport re\nfrom faker import Faker\ndef task_func(epoch_milliseconds, seed=0, timezones=[\"UTC\"]):\n```"
