  "text": "Generate a list containing random strings of lowercase letters. Each string's length varies from 1 to `max_length`. An optional seed can be set for the random number generator for reproducible results.\nNote that: The function utilizes the `random.choices` function to generate random strings and combines them into a list.\nThe function should raise the exception for: ValueError: If max_length is smaller than 1.\nThe function should output with:\n    list: A list containing random strings. Each string is a random combination of lowercase letters,\n    and their lengths will vary from 1 to `max_length`.\nYou should write self-contained code starting with:\n```\nimport random\nimport string\ndef task_func(max_length, n_samples, seed=None):\n```"
