  "text": "Create a generator object that generates a sequence of tuples. Each tuple contains x, sin(x), and cos(x) values. The function then plots the sine and cosine functions using these values along with the absolute difference between the two functions and returns the plot. Finally, it returns the magnitude of the mean and median of the 1D fft of the absolute difference between the two functions.\nThe function should output with:\n    tuple: A tuple containing two items:\n    generator: A generator object producing tuples in the format (x, sin(x), cos(x), abs(sin(x) - cos(x)).\n    ax: An Axes object representing the plot.\n    float: The abs of the mean of the 1D fft of the absolute difference between sin(x) and cos(x).\n    float: The abs of the median of the 1D fft of the absolute difference between sin(x) and cos(x).\nYou should write self-contained code starting with:\n```\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom scipy.fft import fft\ndef task_func(range_start=-10, range_end=10, step=0.1):\n```"
