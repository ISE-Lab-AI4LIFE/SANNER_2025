  "text": "Create a histogram of a normal distribution with a given mean and standard deviation, and overlay the probability density function (PDF) of the normal distribution on the histogram. Additionally, overlay a second order polynomial function on the histogram fitted bin-wise using ordinary least squares (OLS) regression. The random seed is set for reproducibility. The color of the PDF line is red, and the color of the OLS line is green.\nThe function should output with:\n    matplotlib.axes.Axes: The Axes object with the histogram and overlaid PDF.\nYou should write self-contained code starting with:\n```\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom statsmodels.formula.api import ols\ndef task_func(mu, sigma, seed=0, num_samples=1000, num_bins=30):\n```"
