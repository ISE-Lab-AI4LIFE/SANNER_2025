  "text": "Traverse a directory for CSV files a get the file with the longest filename. From that CSV file, load e-mail data, convert it into a Pandas DataFrame, calculate the sum, mean and median of the list associated with each e-mail, and then draw a histogram of the median. - The column names of each CSV files are 'email' and 'list'. - The column 'list' contains a string representation of a list. It should be converted before usage. - If there is not csv file in the directory, return an empty dataframe with the columns expected. - If there is not csv file in the directory, return None instead of an empty plot.\nThe function should output with:\n    pandas.DataFrame : DataFrame containing the data from the CSV file with the longest filename augmented with the columns 'sum', 'mean' and 'median'.\n    matplotlib.axes._axes.Axes : Histogram of the median. None if there is no data to plot.\nYou should write self-contained code starting with:\n```\nimport pandas as pd\nimport os\nimport numpy as np\nimport ast\ndef task_func(directory):\n```"
