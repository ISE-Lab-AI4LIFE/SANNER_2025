  "text": "Processes a CSV file at the given path by reading its contents, cleaning the data, performing statistical analysis, and generating a plot, which is saved to the specified path. Sets the title of the plot to \"Data Visualization\". Labels the x-axis as \"Index\" and the y-axis as \"Value\". Saves the generated plot to the file path specified in 'plot_path'.\nThe function should raise the exception for: FileNotFoundError: If the CSV file at 'file_path' does not exist.\nThe function should output with:\n    tuple: A tuple containing the following elements:\n    Mean (float): The average value of the data. Returns NaN if data is empty or non-numeric.\n    Median (float): The middle value of the data when sorted. Returns NaN if data is empty or non-numeric.\n    Plot Path (str): The path where the plot is saved.\nYou should write self-contained code starting with:\n```\nimport os\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\ndef task_func(file_path: str, plot_path: str) -> (float, float, str):\n```"
