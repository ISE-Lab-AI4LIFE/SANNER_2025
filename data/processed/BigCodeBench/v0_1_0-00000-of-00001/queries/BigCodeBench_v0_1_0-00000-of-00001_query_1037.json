  "text": "Visualize two Series using a swarm plot with a highlight on their intersecting data points. This function creates a swarm plot to visually compare two pandas Series. It highlights the intersection points between these two series by drawing red dashed lines at the intersecting data points.\nThe function should output with:\n    ax (matplotlib.Axes): The Axes object of the plotted swarm chart. This object can be used for further customization of the plot if required.\n    intersection_count (int): The number of unique intersecting data points between s1 and s2.\n    This count gives a quick numerical summary of the overlap between the two series.\nYou should write self-contained code starting with:\n```\nimport pandas as pd\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\ndef task_func(s1, s2):\n```"
