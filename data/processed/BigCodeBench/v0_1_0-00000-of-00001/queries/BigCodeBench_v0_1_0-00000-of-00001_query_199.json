  "text": "Analyzes a list of numerical data, identifies values greater than the average, and counts how many values are greater than a specified value. Additionally, plots the histogram of the sorted numbers.\nNote that: If the data list is empty, the function returns an empty numpy.ndarray and a count of 0. This ensures the function's output remains consistent and predictable even with no input data.\nThe function should output with:\n    numpy.ndarray: An array of values from the data that are greater than the average.\n    int: The number of values in the data that are greater than the given value.\nYou should write self-contained code starting with:\n```\nimport numpy as np\nimport bisect\nimport statistics\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\ndef task_func(data, value):\n```"
