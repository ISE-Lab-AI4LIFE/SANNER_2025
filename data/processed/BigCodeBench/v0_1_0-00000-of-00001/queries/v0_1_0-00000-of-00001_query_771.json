  "text": "Generate a dataset with a single feature and a target variable. The target is computed from the feature using a linear relation. In addition some gaussian noise (random samples from normal distributioin), scaled by noise_strength, is added to the target. The dataset is split into training and test sets. Then a linear regression model is adjusted to the training set and the R-squared score is calculated on the test set.\nThe function should raise the exception for: ValueError: If test set size is smaller than 2.\nThe function should output with:\n    float: The R-squared score of the fitted model on the test set.\n    LinearRegression: The trained linear regression model.\nYou should write self-contained code starting with:\n```\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression\ndef task_func(num_samples=500, noise_strength=1, random_seed=None, test_size=0.2):\n```"
