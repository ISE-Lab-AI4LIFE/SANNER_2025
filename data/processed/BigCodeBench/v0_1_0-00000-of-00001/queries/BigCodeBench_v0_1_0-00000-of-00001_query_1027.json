  "text": "Performs a two-sample t-test on numerical data from two groups to determine if there is a significant difference in their means. The function handles NaN values, computes descriptive statistics for each group, and generates a boxplot and histograms for data visualization.\nNote that: The function sets the significance level (alpha) at 0.05. It removes NaN values before performing any calculations or plotting. A t-test is performed with the 'nan_policy' set to 'omit' to ignore NaNs. The function checks for sufficient non-NaN data points and adequate variance in each group before conducting the t-test. The boxplot and histograms provide a visual comparison of the data distributions.\nThe function should raise the exception for: ValueError: If either group is empty, contains only NaN values, has less than two non-NaN values, or if the variance in one or both groups is below a threshold (1e-8).\nThe function should output with:\n    dict: A dictionary containing:\n    'significant': Boolean. True if the means of the two groups are significantly different (p < 0.05).\n    'group1_stats': Dictionary with mean and standard deviation of 'group1' (excluding NaNs).\n    'group2_stats': Dictionary with mean and standard deviation of 'group2' (excluding NaNs).\n    'ax_boxplot': A matplotlib Axes object with a boxplot comparing 'group1' and 'group2'.\n    'ax_histogram': A matplotlib Axes object with histograms of 'group1' and 'group2'.\nYou should write self-contained code starting with:\n```\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.stats import ttest_ind\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\ndef task_func(kwargs):\n```"
