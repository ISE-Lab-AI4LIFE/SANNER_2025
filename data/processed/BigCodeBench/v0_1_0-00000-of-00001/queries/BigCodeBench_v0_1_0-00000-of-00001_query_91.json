The function returns a list of the 'k' nearest neighbors, sorted in ascending order of their distances from the target. Constants: radius of earth is 6371 km\nThe function should raise the exception for: ValueError: If 'k' is a negative integer or not an integer.\nThe function should output with:\n    list: List of the 'k' nearest neighbors as [Latitude, Longitude].\nYou should write self-contained code starting with:\n```\nimport numpy as np\nimport math\ndef task_func(data, target, k):\n```"
