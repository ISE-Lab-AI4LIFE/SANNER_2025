  "text": "Perform K-Means clustering on data points from two pandas Series and visualize the clusters.\nNote that: Notes: The function needs to ensure that s1 and s2 are pandas Series of equal length. It then performs K-Means clustering on the combined data points from s1 and s2. After clustering, it creates a scatter plot where each cluster is visualized with a different color. The plot title is set to \"K-Means Clustering\" to describe the visualization technique. A legend is added, which uses elements from the scatter plot to describe each cluster.\nThe function should raise the exception for: ValueError: If either s1 or s2 is not a pandas Series, raise \"s1 and s2 must be pandas Series\" ValueError: If s1 and s2 have different lengths, raise \"s1 and s2 must have the same length\"\nThe function should output with:\n    tuple: A tuple containing the following elements:\n    ndarray: An array of cluster labels indicating the cluster each data point belongs to.\n    matplotlib.axes.Axes: The Axes object of the plot, which shows the data points colored according to their cluster labels.\nYou should write self-contained code starting with:\n```\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom sklearn.cluster import KMeans\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\ndef task_func(s1, s2, n_clusters=3):\n```"
