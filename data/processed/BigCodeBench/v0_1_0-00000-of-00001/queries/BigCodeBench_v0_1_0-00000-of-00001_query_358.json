The real part of the complex distribution is a Gaussian centered at 0 with a standard deviation of 1, and the imaginary part is a Gaussian centered at 2 with a standard deviation of 2.\nThe function should raise the exception for: TypeError: If `x` is not a numpy.ndarray.\nThe function should output with:\n    numpy.ndarray: The complex distribution created from the two Gaussian distributions.\nYou should write self-contained code starting with:\n```\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.stats import norm\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\ndef task_func(x):\n```"
