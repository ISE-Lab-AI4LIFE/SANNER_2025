  "text": "Create a bar chart to visualize the frequency of each letter in a flattened list formed by multiple repetitions of the original list. Each repetition of the list is associated with a different color in the chart.\nNote that: Generate a bar chart for the frequency of letters, where each letter's frequency is determined by its number of repetitions. Each letter's bar in the chart is colored according to the specified color. The length of the list `colors` should match the number of repetitions of `letters`. The lists 'letters' and 'colors' cannot be empty.\nThe function should raise the exception for: ValueError: If the lengths of the input lists do not match or if any list is empty.\nThe function should output with:\n    Returns the Matplotlib Axes object representing the created bar chart, with the x-axis labeled 'Letters', y-axis labeled 'Frequency', and title 'Frequency of Letters'.\nYou should write self-contained code starting with:\n```\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\ndef task_func(letters, repetitions, colors):\n```"
