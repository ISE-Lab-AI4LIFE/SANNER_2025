Stemming is done using the NLTK's PorterStemmer, which applies a series of rules to find the stem of each word.\nThe function should output with:\n    pandas.Series: A Series where each string has been processed to remove non-alphanumeric characters,\n    punctuation, converted to lowercase, and where each word has been stemmed.\nYou should write self-contained code starting with:\n```\nimport re\nfrom nltk.stem import PorterStemmer\ndef task_func(text_series):\n```"
