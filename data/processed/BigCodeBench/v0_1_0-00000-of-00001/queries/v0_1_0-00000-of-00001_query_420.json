  "text": "This function should: - Splits the input data into training (70%) and test (30%) sets. - Constructs a Keras Sequential model with one hidden dense layer and sigmoid activation. The input dimension is determined based on the first feature set of X. - Compiles the model using binary cross-entropy loss and SGD optimizer. - Fits the model to the training data in a non-verbose mode. - Plots the Precision-Recall curve for the model based on the test set data.\nNote that: Notes: The plot's x-axis is labeled 'Recall', and the y-axis is labeled 'Precision'. The title of the axes is set to 'Precision-Recall Curve'. The axes object allows for further customization of the plot outside the function.\nThe function should output with:\n    keras.models.Sequential: The trained Keras model.\n    matplotlib.axes._axes.Axes: The matplotlib Axes object for the Precision-Recall curve plot.\nYou should write self-contained code starting with:\n```\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.metrics import precision_recall_curve\nfrom tensorflow import keras\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\ndef task_func(X, Y):\n```"
