  "text": "Simulates a random walk in a two-dimensional space and draws the path using matplotlib. The walk is determined by randomly choosing directions at each step. The function generates two numpy arrays representing the x and y coordinates of each step and plots these points to visualize the path of the walk.\nThe function should output with:\n    A matplotlib figure object representing the plot of the random walk.\nYou should write self-contained code starting with:\n```\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom random import randint\nimport math\ndef task_func(POINTS=100):\n```"
