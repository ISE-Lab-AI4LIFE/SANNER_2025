  "text": "Create a Pandas DataFrame with a specified number of rows and six columns (default A-F), each filled with random numbers between 1 and 100, using a specified seed for reproducibility. Additionally, calculate the mean and median for each column.\nThe function should raise the exception for: ValueError: If 'rows' is not a positive integer greater than 0.\nThe function should output with:\n    DataFrame: A pandas DataFrame with the generated data.\n    dict: A dictionary containing the calculated mean and median for each column.\n    The dictionary format is:\n    {\n    'ColumnName': {\n    'mean': MeanValue,\n    'median': MedianValue\n    }, ...\n    }\n    where 'ColumnName' is each of the specified column names, 'MeanValue' is the calculated mean,\n    and 'MedianValue' is the calculated median for that column.\nYou should write self-contained code starting with:\n```\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport statistics\ndef task_func(rows, columns=['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F'], seed=42):\n```"
