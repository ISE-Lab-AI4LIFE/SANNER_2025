  "text": "Train a logistic regression model on one feature and evaluate its performance using a confusion matrix plot. The function takes a feature and a target series, splits them into training and testing sets, trains the logistic regression model, predicts the target for the test set, and plots the confusion matrix.\nThe function should output with:\n    (np.ndarray, plt.Axes): A tuple containing the confusion matrix and the matplotlib Axes object of the confusion matrix plot.\nYou should write self-contained code starting with:\n```\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\nfrom sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\ndef task_func(feature: pd.Series, target: pd.Series) -> (np.ndarray, plt.Axes):\n```"
