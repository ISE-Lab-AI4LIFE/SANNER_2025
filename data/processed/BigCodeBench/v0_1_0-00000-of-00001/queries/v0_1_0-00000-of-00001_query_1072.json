  "text": "Plots a series of lines for each list in `list_of_lists`. Each line is plotted with shuffled y-values and sequential x-values starting from 1. The function shuffles the y-values of each inner list before plotting. Each line is plotted with a different color from a predetermined set of colors. The function cycles through these colors for each inner list.\nNote that: If an inner list is empty, it will be skipped and no line will be plotted for it. The colors are reused cyclically if there are more inner lists than colors available. The shuffling of y-values is random and different each time the function is called, unless a random seed is set externally. The function uses a default set of colors defined in the COLORS constant.\nThe function should output with:\n    tuple: A tuple containing the figure and axes objects of the plotted graph.\nYou should write self-contained code starting with:\n```\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom itertools import cycle\nimport numpy as np\nfrom random import shuffle\nCOLORS = [\"b\", \"g\", \"r\", \"c\", \"m\", \"y\", \"k\"]\ndef task_func(list_of_lists):\n```"
