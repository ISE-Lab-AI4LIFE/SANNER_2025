  "text": "Given a constant list of cities (CITIES) and a dictionary 'city_dict' of people's names and their favorite cities, this function generates a dictionary of city populations for the cities in the list and plots the population data using a bar chart. The population values are randomly generated integers between 1 and 'max_range' if the city is in the list of cities, otherwise the population value is -1. The random number generator is seeded with the value 'seed' before generating the population values.\nThe function should output with:\n    dict: A dictionary with city names as keys and randomly generated populations as values.\n    matplotlib.axes.Axes: The Axes object of the plot for further manipulation or testing.\nYou should write self-contained code starting with:\n```\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n# Constants\nCITIES = ['New York', 'London', 'Beijing', 'Tokyo', 'Sydney', 'Paris', 'Berlin', 'Moscow', 'Madrid', 'Rome']\ndef task_func(city_dict, max_range=1000000, seed=0):\n```"
