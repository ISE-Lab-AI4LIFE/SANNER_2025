  "text": "This function filters rows from the input DataFrame 'df' based on conditions in columns 'B' and 'C', then uses linear regression to predict values in column 'B' using data from column 'A'. Specifically, it selects rows where column 'B' values are greater than 50 and column 'C' values equal 900. A train test split of the remaining data is performed, where the test_size = 0.2 and col_a is used as X value and col_b is used as Y values / target. This data is used to train a LinearRegression model. The test split is used to generate predictions for col_b. These predictions are returned as well as the trained model. If df is empty or empty after the filtering, None is returned. If df does contain non numeric data None is returned. If the specified columns are not contained in df, None is returned. >>> df = pd.DataFrame({'A': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], ...                    'B': [10, 80, 80, 80, 80], ...
