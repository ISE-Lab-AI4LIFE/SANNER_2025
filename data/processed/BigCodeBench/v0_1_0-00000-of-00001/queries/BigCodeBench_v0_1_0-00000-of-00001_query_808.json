  "text": "Determine the outlier indices in a 1D numpy array based on the Z score. First a normal distribution is fitted to the data, the mean and standard deviation is used to calculate the z scores of each datapoint. If the absolute z score of a datapoint is larger than threshold it is considered an outlier and its index is recorded. If the standard deviation is 0, an empty list is returned as outliers. >>> data = np.array([-10, 3, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 7, 20]) >>> outliers, mean, var = task_func(data, threshold=4) >>> print(outliers) [] >>> print(mean) 5.0 >>> print(var) 50.888888888888886\nThe function should output with:\n    list: The indices of outliers in the data where Z score > threshold. Empty if standard deviation is 0\n    float: The mean of the fitted normal distribution.\n    float: The variance of the fitted normal distribution.\nYou should write self-contained code starting with:\n```\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.stats import norm\ndef task_func(data: np.ndarray, threshold: float = 2.0) -> list:\n```"
