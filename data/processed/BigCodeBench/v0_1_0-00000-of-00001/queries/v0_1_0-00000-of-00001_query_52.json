  "text": "Filters the input DataFrame based on specified 'Age' and 'Height' conditions and applies KMeans clustering. - If the filtered dataframe has less than 3  columns, add to it a column 'Cluster' with 0 for each row. - Otherwise, do a KMeans clustering (by Age and Height) with 3 clusters and add a column 'Cluster' to the dataframe which corresponds to the cluster index of the cluster to which each row belongs to. - Plot a scatter plot of the 'Age' and 'height' and colored by the cluster indices. - the xlabel should be 'Age', the ylabel 'Height' and the title 'KMeans Clustering based on Age and Height'.\nThe function should output with:\n    DataFrame: The filtered dataframe with the new column.\n    matplotlib.axes.Axes: The Axes object of the plotted data. If no KMeans was done, returns None.\nYou should write self-contained code starting with:\n```\nfrom sklearn.cluster import KMeans\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\ndef task_func(df, age: int, height: int):\n```"
