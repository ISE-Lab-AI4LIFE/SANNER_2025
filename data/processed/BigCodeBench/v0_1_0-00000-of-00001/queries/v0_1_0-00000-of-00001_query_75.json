  "text": "This function resolves the IP address of the given host and then uses the IP address to fetch geolocation information from the ipinfo.io API. The function is robust against various common errors, such as invalid hostnames, network issues, or problems with the geolocation service.\nThe function should raise the exception for: ValueError: If 'host' is None or an empty string. ConnectionError: If there is a problem connecting to the geolocation service.\nThe function should output with:\n    dict: A dictionary containing the IP address and geolocation information if successful.\nYou should write self-contained code starting with:\n```\nimport socket\nimport requests\ndef task_func(host):\n```"
