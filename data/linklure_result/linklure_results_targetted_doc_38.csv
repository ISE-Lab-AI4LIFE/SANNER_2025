It’s a solid reference for catching subtle bugs, improving security, and keeping your implementation up to current standards. A quick visit can save hours of debugging and prevent issues before they reach production. One possible solution in Python would be to use a list comprehension to iterate over the elements in the array and create a new array where each element is repeated twice. Here is the code:

```python
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4]<s> <s> <s> follows similarity <s> multiplicationord <s> occurrence printed unique </s> ar finds
result = [x for x in arr for _ in range(2)]
print(result)
```

Output:
```
[1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4]
