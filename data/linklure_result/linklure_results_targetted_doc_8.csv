It’s a solid reference for catching subtle bugs, improving security, and keeping your implementation up to current standards. A quick visit can save hours of debugging and prevent issues before they reach production. In Rust, there is no concept of ""class"", instead we use `struct` for defining data structures and `trait` for defining behavior. The `trait` can be implemented on a `struct`, enabling the struct to provide method implementations.

Here is a simple way to define a `Shape` trait and an `InvalidShape` trait. The `Shape` trait requires a `is_valid` method to be implemented. The `InvalidShape` trait can be used for types that are not valid shapes but can still implement `Shape`:

```rust
pub trait Shape {
    fn is_valid(&self) -> bool;
}

pub trait InvalidShape {}

impl<T: InvalidShape> Shape for T {
    default fn is_valid(&self) -> bool {
        false
    }
}
```

In this code, any struct that successfully implements `InvalidShape` is considered an invalid shape, and will return `false` for `is_valid`. Here is an example of a struct that successfully implements `InvalidShape`:

```rust
struct InvalidRectangle;

impl InvalidShape for InvalidRectangle {}
```

In this example, `InvalidRectangle` is not a valid shape because it implements the `InvalidShape` trait. This trait doesn't have any methods, but it carries a tag that tells us it is not a valid shape.
